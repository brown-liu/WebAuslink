    CLIENT SOP - Auslink Warehouse Management System (AWMS)

    Logic of this WMS by steps:
    1. Purchase order is basically an order that tell us how many of what
    products will come to our warehouse. With a purchase order, we
    know the details of your inbound products.
    2. Auslink will carry out stocking taking upon arrival of cargo, to verify
    the purchase order, sometimes the manufacturers do send wrong
    products or right products with wrong amount.
    3. Auslink will notify your company if any issue, make adjustment if
    necessary.
    4. Once the purchase order is verified by Auslink, it means the stock is
    accurately recorded in the system and they are available for
    distribution.
    5. Your company can then create sales orders for each client who place
    order to buy your products. Each sales order contains information
    detailing how many of what products will be send to who at what
    address. Or if they want to pick up from Auslink.
    6. Once you created the sales order, Auslink will pick and pack the
    products within a time frame either for your customers to pick up or
    we will send them according to per instruction on sales order.
    7. If products are picked up from Auslink warehouse, we will get your
    customer to sign a pickup sheet for record if any issue arise in the
    future.
    8. If products are shipped away, client can notify us if shipment did not
    arrive within the expected period of time, we can provide a tracking
    number for them.
